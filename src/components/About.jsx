          <p>
            I’m Moses—an AI Product Manager who blends user empathy with systems thinking to build products that drive measurable outcomes. I lead with clarity, communicate with rigor, and obsess over quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            My career spans roles at Arca, Arnergy, TasAfrica, Bunce, and Termii. I’ve operated across discovery, strategy, and delivery—owning the product lifecycle end-to-end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside work, I contribute to the community through teaching, content, and mentorship—sharing practical lessons that help PMs do their best work.
